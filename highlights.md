# 🌆 Website Highlight Trio — “Shared Rides. Shared Impact.”

---

## 🏙️ 1. Cleaner City — CO₂ Reduction

**Analogy:** “A day without cars in Stockholm”

**Headline:**  
“We saved enough CO₂ to give Stockholm a car-free day.”

**Subtext:**  
“Thanks to our community, the city’s air got a little clearer — one shared ride at a time.”

**Visual Idea:**  
- Aerial illustration of Stockholm — streets empty, blue sky, bright atmosphere.  
- Transition animation: from cars → people walking, biking, trams.

**Tone:**  
Optimistic, local pride, collective action.

## 🚗 2. Shared Journeys — Community Impact

**Metric:** Number of trips shared  

**Headline:**  
“12.4 million rides shared — and counting.”

**Subtext:**  
“Every trip means fewer cars, new connections, and a city that moves together.”

**Visual Idea:**  
- Map-style dots connecting across Stockholm — forming a heart, smile, or road pattern.  
- Animation idea: lines light up as trips happen in real time.

**Tone:**  
Human, connective, optimistic. Reflects scale and unity.

## 😊 3. Happier Riders — Experience Metric

**Metric:** User happiness / satisfaction rate  

**Headline:**  
“98% of riders arrive with a smile.”

**Subtext:**  
“Friendly rides, good vibes — because sharing the journey makes it better.”

**Visual Idea:**  
- Simple smiling faces or emoji-inspired icons appearing in car windows.  
- Light, warm color palette (yellow, soft blue, white).

**Tone:**  
Warm, personal, emotional — balances the environmental message with human happiness.

## ✨ Unified Design Language

| Element | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Visual System** | Minimal, icon-based illustrations (clean line art or light 3D). A consistent motion cue: fade, grow, connect. |
| **Color Palette** | Stockholm-inspired: Nordic blues, white, soft green, and warm yellow. |
| **Typography** | Bold sans-serif for numbers, soft round sans-serif for subtext. |
| **Animation Timing** | Each highlight reveals sequentially (≈1.5s each). |
| **Tone of Voice** | Hopeful, inclusive, grounded in reality — no bragging, just pride in shared progress. |

## 📊 Example Layout Mock (Copy-Ready)

| Metric | Headline | Subtext |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **12.4M** | Rides shared — and counting. | Every trip means fewer cars and new connections. |
| **98%** | Riders arrive with a smile. | Because sharing the journey makes it better. |
| **1 day** | Stockholm’s air, saved for a day. | We’ve prevented enough CO₂ to clear the city’s skies. |
